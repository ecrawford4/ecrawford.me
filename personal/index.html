            <h3>Performance</h3>

            <p>
                I have been a musician since 5th grade, and I have been an oboist since 7th grade.
                Music has been a major part of my life, and I have been involved in music
                performance throughout my education.
            </p>
            <!-- add picture of my oboe & english horn on the stand -->
            <!-- add picture of me playing in various ensembles before college -->
            <p>
                I have been heavily involved in music performance at Eastern Washington university.
                I have performed in the EWU Wind Ensemble, Symphony Orchestra, and Jazz Band.
                I have also performed in small ensembles, such as Eastern's Woodwind Quartet, and
                on other students' recitals as an accompanist, and on gigs which I recieved through
                my connections with students and faculty.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my time at Eastern, I have
                recieved personal instruction to prepare for professional auditions. The music department
                at Eastern Washington University has a commitment to
                prepare students for professional careers in music. Pursuant to this end,
                Eastern's ensembles frequently perform music from a standard repertoire.
            </p>

            <!-- add picture of me playing in the EWU Symphony Orchestra -->
            <p>With Eastern's Symphony Orchestra, I have performed
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOk8Tm815lE">Beethoven's 5th Symphony</a>,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXcU7h3uVlg">Dvo&#345;&#225;k's New World Symphony</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC9uQq1HiOY">Brahms's Variations</a>.
                Recordings of these performances are available on Eastern's
                <a href="https://dc.ewu.edu/music_performances/">General Collection of Music Performances</a>
